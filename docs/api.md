# 1. REST API

**Status:** active. **Last updated:** 2026-06-13.

The REST API is a first-class product surface: everything the web app can
do is available to scripts, shortcuts, and other tools over plain HTTP.
Interactive OpenAPI documentation is served at `/docs` (schema at
`/openapi.json`).

All endpoints live under the `/api` prefix and exchange JSON unless noted.
Decimal money values (`amount_total`) are serialized as JSON **strings**
(e.g. `"123.45"`) to preserve precision.

**Every `/api` endpoint requires authentication** (session cookie or
bearer token — see 1.9) except `POST /api/auth/login`. `/healthz` is open
(container healthcheck, no database access). Unauthenticated requests get
`401` with the generic body `{"detail": "not authenticated"}`.

## 1.1 Endpoint summary

| Method | Path | Purpose |
|--------|------|---------|
| POST   | `/api/auth/login` | Log in; sets session + CSRF cookies (no auth required) |
| POST   | `/api/auth/logout` | Log out; revokes the session, clears cookies |
| GET    | `/api/auth/me` | The authenticated user |
| GET    | `/api/auth/tokens` | List your API tokens (never their secrets) |
| POST   | `/api/auth/tokens` | Create an API token; secret shown **once** |
| DELETE | `/api/auth/tokens/{id}` | Revoke one of your API tokens |
| POST   | `/api/ask` | Ask a natural-language question; cited answer |
| POST   | `/api/documents` | Upload a file for ingestion |
| GET    | `/api/documents` | List / search documents |
| GET    | `/api/documents/{id}` | Full document detail |
| PATCH  | `/api/documents/{id}` | Edit metadata |
| DELETE | `/api/documents/{id}` | Soft-delete |
| POST   | `/api/documents/{id}/extract` | Queue metadata re-extraction |
| GET    | `/api/documents/{id}/original` | Download the original file |
| GET    | `/api/documents/{id}/searchable.pdf` | Download the OCR searchable PDF |
| GET    | `/api/documents/{id}/thumbnail` | First-page WebP thumbnail |
| GET    | `/api/kinds` | Document kinds with counts |
| GET    | `/api/senders` | Senders with counts |
| GET    | `/api/tags` | Tags with counts |
| GET    | `/api/jobs` | Recent background jobs |
| GET    | `/api/settings` | Your display preferences (dashboard fields + page-canvas tone + tile preview) |
| PUT    | `/api/settings` | Update your dashboard fields |
| PUT    | `/api/settings/appearance` | Update your page-canvas tone and tile preview |

Soft-deleted documents return **404** from every per-document endpoint and
never appear in lists. Other error shapes: `404` unknown document, `422`
validation problem (FastAPI detail body), `409`/`413`/`415` on upload (see
[ingestion.md](ingestion.md)).

## 1.2 Upload — `POST /api/documents`

Multipart upload (`file` field). `201` with `{id, sha256, status,
duplicate}` for a new document, `200` for duplicate content (pointing at
the existing document), `409` if the content matches a soft-deleted
document, `413` over the size limit, `415` unsupported type. The
authenticated user is recorded as the document's uploader. Full
ingestion semantics are documented in [ingestion.md](ingestion.md).

## 1.3 List and search — `GET /api/documents`

### 1.3.1 Query parameters

| Param | Type | Meaning |
|-------|------|---------|
| `q` | string | Full-text search, [websearch syntax](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/textsearch-controls.html) (quoted phrases, `OR`, `-exclusion`) |
| `kind` | string | Kind slug (e.g. `invoice`) |
| `sender_id` | int | Sender id |
| `tag` | string, repeatable | Tag slug; repeating the parameter ANDs them (`?tag=energie&tag=wonen` requires both) |
| `language` | enum | `nld` / `eng` / `mixed` / `unknown` |
| `status` | enum | `received` / `ocr` / `extract` / `indexed` / `failed` |
| `date_from`, `date_to` | date | Inclusive bounds on `document_date` |
| `source` | enum | `upload` / `consume` / `email` / `api` / `mcp` / `import` |
| `limit` | int | Page size, default 25, max 100 |
| `offset` | int | Rows to skip, default 0 |

All filters compose (AND), including with `q`.

### 1.3.2 Response

```json
{
  "items": [
    {
      "id": 12, "title": "Energierekening mei 2026", "summary": "…",
      "kind": {"slug": "invoice", "name": "Invoice"},
      "sender": {"id": 3, "name": "Eneco"},
      "tags": [{"slug": "energie", "name": "Energie"}],
      "document_date": "2026-05-15", "language": "nld",
      "status": "indexed", "mime_type": "application/pdf",
      "page_count": 2, "created_at": "2026-06-10T12:00:00Z",
      "has_searchable_pdf": true, "has_thumbnail": true,
      "amount_total": "123.45", "currency": "EUR",
      "snippet": "uw <b>rekening</b> voor mei … totaal",
      "rank": 0.31
    }
  ],
  "total": 1, "limit": 25, "offset": 0
}
```

`total` is the filtered count before pagination. `snippet` and `rank` are
only present (non-null) when `q` is given. Tags are sorted by slug.
`amount_total` (JSON string, preserves decimal precision) and `currency`
(3-letter code) are `null` when not set on the document — they were
previously detail-only fields and are now included in list items so
dashboard tiles can display financial totals.

### 1.3.3 Search semantics

- `q` is parsed with `websearch_to_tsquery` and matched against **both**
  generated tsvector columns — `search_vector_nl` (`dutch` config) and
  `search_vector_en` (`english` config), OR-combined. Stemming therefore
  works in both languages: `q=rekening` finds "rekeningen", `q=policy`
  finds "policies".
- The rank is `greatest(ts_rank(nl), ts_rank(en))` — the best of the two
  language interpretations — and results are ordered by it, descending.
- `snippet` is `ts_headline` over `ocr_text`, generated with whichever
  config produced the higher rank, capped with
  `MaxFragments=2, MaxWords=12, MinWords=4, ShortWord=2,
  FragmentDelimiter=" … "` and the **default `<b>`/`</b>` markers**.

> **Rendering snippets safely.** `ocr_text` is raw OCR output and is NOT
> HTML-escaped by the server; a scanned document could contain literal
> HTML. Clients must render the snippet as plain text and handle the
> `<b>`…`</b>` markers deliberately (e.g. escape everything, then convert
> the known markers back to highlighting). Never inject a snippet into the
> DOM as HTML.

Without `q`, ordering is `document_date DESC NULLS LAST, created_at DESC`.

## 1.4 Detail — `GET /api/documents/{id}`

Everything in the list item, plus:

- `ocr_text`, `ocr_confidence`
- `amount_total` (JSON string), `currency`, `due_date`, `expiry_date`
- `source`, `original_filename`, `sha256`
- `extraction` — the provenance block written by Claude extraction
  (`prompt_version`, `model`, `confidence`, token/cost accounting,
  `fields_set`, …), or `null` if extraction has not run. This is a
  deliberate subset: the raw `extra` JSONB column is not exposed
  wholesale.
- `user_edited_fields` — fields locked by user edits (see 1.5)
- `events` — the full ingestion audit trail, oldest first:
  `[{event, detail, created_at}, …]`

## 1.5 Edit metadata — `PATCH /api/documents/{id}`

JSON body; only the fields present in the body change. Editable fields:

| Body field | Notes |
|------------|-------|
| `title`, `summary` | `null` clears |
| `document_date`, `due_date`, `expiry_date` | ISO dates, `null` clears |
| `kind_slug` | Must be an existing kind slug (`422` otherwise); `null` clears the kind |
| `sender` | Sender **name**; upserted case-insensitively (same rule extraction uses); `null` clears |
| `tags` | **Full replacement** list of slugs; unknown slugs are created; `[]` clears; `null` is rejected |
| `language` | `nld` / `eng` / `mixed` / `unknown`; `null` rejected |
| `amount_total` | Decimal as string or number; `null` clears |
| `currency` | 3-letter code, normalized to upper case; `null` clears |

Every edited field is appended to `extra["user_edited_fields"]` (mapped to
storage names: `kind_slug`→`kind_id`, `sender`→`sender_id`). Re-extraction
(W6) honours this list and never overwrites user-edited fields. An
ingestion event `user_edited` is recorded with the changed field names.
Returns the updated document detail.

## 1.6 Delete — `DELETE /api/documents/{id}`

Soft delete: sets `deleted_at`, records a `deleted` ingestion event,
returns `204`. The document then 404s on every endpoint and disappears
from lists; its file and row are kept. Re-uploading identical content
returns `409` (see ingestion.md). **Restore is out of scope for now** —
undeleting means clearing `deleted_at` manually in the database.

## 1.7 File downloads

- `GET /api/documents/{id}/original` — streams the stored original with
  its real `Content-Type` and a `Content-Disposition: attachment` header
  carrying the original filename.
- `GET /api/documents/{id}/searchable.pdf` — the OCR-produced searchable
  PDF (`application/pdf`); `404` if the document has none (text-layer
  PDFs, photos, and plain text don't produce one).

Both endpoints take `?disposition=inline|attachment` (default
`attachment`; anything else is a `422`). `inline` keeps the filename in
the header but lets the browser render the file instead of downloading
it — the detail page's iframe/img previews depend on this, because an
attachment response inside an `<iframe>`/`<img>` shows nothing and
triggers a download instead.
- `GET /api/documents/{id}/thumbnail` — first-page thumbnail,
  `image/webp`, ~480 px wide. Generated by a background job after OCR;
  `404` until it exists (and always for plain-text documents).
  `has_thumbnail` in list/detail responses reflects file existence.

## 1.8 Jobs — `GET /api/jobs`

Most recent background jobs (newest first) from the Procrastinate queue:
`[{id, status, task_name, attempts, scheduled_at, document_id}, …]`.
`limit` 1–500, default 50.

## 1.8.1 Re-extraction — `POST /api/documents/{id}/extract`

Queues the W6 metadata-extraction task for one document and returns
**`202`** with `{"queued": true, "job_id": <procrastinate job id>}` —
the work happens in the background worker. Works on documents in any
state (including already `indexed`); the run honours
`extra["user_edited_fields"]` (user edits are never overwritten) and
never removes tags. `404` for unknown or deleted documents. Track the
outcome via the document's `extraction` provenance block and
`extraction_*` audit events (GET detail, 1.4) or `GET /api/jobs`.
Extraction can also be *skipped* (disabled, missing API key, daily
budget reached) — that is recorded as an `extraction_skipped` event,
not an error.

## 1.8.2 Taxonomy — `GET /api/kinds`, `/api/senders`, `/api/tags`

Plain JSON arrays for filter options and edit forms; the same data the
MCP `list_*` tools return (one shared service, `library.taxonomy`).
Counts exclude soft-deleted documents; zero-count entries are included.

- `GET /api/kinds` → `[{slug, name, document_count}, …]`, ordered by
  slug. Kinds are the fixed seeded set.
- `GET /api/senders` → `[{id, name, document_count}, …]`, ordered by
  name.
- `GET /api/tags` → `[{slug, name, document_count}, …]`, ordered by
  name.

## 1.9 Authentication

Two interchangeable credentials, checked by a single dependency on every
`/api` route:

1. **Browser session cookie** — set by `POST /api/auth/login`.
2. **Bearer API token** — `Authorization: Bearer library_…`, for scripts,
   shortcuts, and the MCP server.

When an `Authorization: Bearer` header is present it is authoritative: the
token is validated and cookies are ignored.

Passwords are hashed with **Argon2id** (pwdlib). Accounts are managed from
the host with the bundled CLI — there is no signup endpoint:

```console
library user add anna --display-name "Anna"   # prompts for password
library user passwd anna
library user disable anna                      # also revokes all sessions/tokens
library user list
```

### 1.9.1 Sessions — `POST /api/auth/login`

JSON body `{"username": "...", "password": "..."}`. On success, `200` with
`{id, username, display_name, preferences}` and two cookies:

| Cookie | Flags | Purpose |
|--------|-------|---------|
| `library_session` | `HttpOnly; Secure; SameSite=Lax; Path=/` | Opaque 256-bit session token; only its SHA-256 hash is stored server-side |
| `library_csrftoken` | `Secure; SameSite=Lax; Path=/` (readable by JS) | CSRF double-submit value |

Wrong username, wrong password, and disabled accounts all return the same
generic `401` (`{"detail": "invalid credentials"}`) — no account
enumeration. The `Secure` flag follows the `LIBRARY_COOKIE_SECURE` setting
(default `true`; set `false` only for plain-HTTP dev).

Sessions live in Postgres and expire after `LIBRARY_SESSION_TTL_DAYS`
(default 30) of inactivity, with **sliding expiry**: any authenticated use
pushes the expiry forward (the refresh is write-throttled to at most once
per ~5 minutes). `POST /api/auth/logout` deletes the session row — the
cookie is dead server-side immediately — and clears both cookies.

`GET /api/auth/me` returns `{id, username, display_name, preferences}` for
the authenticated user (either credential). The login response (`POST
/api/auth/login`) returns the same shape. `preferences` is
`{"dashboard_fields": [...], "background_tone": "neutral", "tile_preview": "full_width"}` —
the resolved preference set (defaults filled; see 1.10).

### 1.9.2 CSRF (cookie requests only)

State-changing requests (`POST`/`PATCH`/`PUT`/`DELETE`) authenticated by
the **session cookie** must echo the CSRF cookie in a header:

```
X-CSRF-Token: <value of the library_csrftoken cookie>
```

Missing or mismatched header → `403`. Exempt: `GET`/`HEAD`/`OPTIONS`,
requests carrying an `Authorization: Bearer` header, and
`POST /api/auth/login` itself.

### 1.9.3 API tokens

`POST /api/auth/tokens` with `{"name": "ios-shortcut"}` returns `201`:

```json
{"id": 4, "name": "ios-shortcut", "token": "library_3q2…", "created_at": "…"}
```

**The `token` secret is shown exactly once.** Only its SHA-256 hash is
stored; it cannot be retrieved again — lose it, revoke it, make a new one.
`GET /api/auth/tokens` lists your tokens as
`[{id, name, created_at, last_used_at, revoked_at}, …]` (never secrets;
`last_used_at` updates are throttled to ~5-minute granularity).
`DELETE /api/auth/tokens/{id}` revokes the token (sets `revoked_at`;
takes effect immediately) and returns `204`; tokens belonging to other
users `404`. Tokens do not expire — revocation is the lifecycle.

Usage:

```console
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer library_3q2…" \
  "https://library.example.org/api/documents?q=rekening"

curl -H "Authorization: Bearer library_3q2…" \
  -F "file=@scan.pdf" https://library.example.org/api/documents
```

Bearer requests are CSRF-exempt (the header cannot be set cross-site).
Revoked or unknown tokens, and tokens of disabled users, get `401`.

## 1.10 Settings — `GET /api/settings`, `PUT /api/settings`, `PUT /api/settings/appearance`

Per-user display preferences: which metadata fields appear on the
dashboard tiles, the page-canvas tone behind them, and how each tile
previews the document's first page. Auth and CSRF
rules are identical to the rest of `/api` (§1.9). All preferences live in
one JSONB `preferences` blob on the user row; writes are split per concern
(fields vs appearance) so each Settings tab saves independently, and every
write preserves the sibling keys.

### 1.10.1 `GET /api/settings`

Returns the resolved preference set for the authenticated user. If the
user has never saved preferences, the **default set** is returned (no
`404` or empty body).

```json
{"dashboard_fields": ["kind", "sender", "tags", "date", "language", "status"], "background_tone": "neutral", "tile_preview": "full_width"}
```

### 1.10.2 `PUT /api/settings`

Body: `{"dashboard_fields": [...]}`. Persists the list and returns the
**full** resolved preference set (same shape as GET, incl. `background_tone`).
Auth + CSRF apply.

**Valid field keys** (the 8 selectable fields):

| Key | What it controls on the tile |
|-----|-------------------------------|
| `kind` | Document type tag (blue) |
| `sender` | Correspondent name |
| `tags` | Document tags row (capped at 4 + "+N" overflow) |
| `date` | Document date |
| `language` | Language tag (grey) |
| `status` | Status tag (red/yellow; only shown when non-indexed) |
| `amount` | Financial total (`amount_total` + `currency`, formatted) |
| `file_type` | Derived file type label (PDF / Image / Text / File) |

**Default set** (what new users see): `kind`, `sender`, `tags`, `date`,
`language`, `status`.

**Tolerant validation.** Unknown keys in `dashboard_fields` are silently
dropped — the server returns `200` with the cleaned set, never `422`.
Duplicates are also removed. This means a hand-edited database row or a
client sending a renamed field key can never break the dashboard.

**Explicit empty list** is honoured: `{"dashboard_fields": []}` is valid
and results in tiles showing only the title and thumbnail. The absent-key
rule applies only on read (`GET` / login / `GET /api/auth/me`): if the
`dashboard_fields` key is missing from the stored blob, defaults are
filled in; if the key is present but the list is empty, the empty list
is returned as-is.

### 1.10.3 `PUT /api/settings/appearance`

Body: `{"background_tone": "<tone>", "tile_preview": "<mode>"}`. Persists both
appearance settings and returns the full resolved preference set (same shape
as GET). Auth + CSRF apply. The tone applies to the light-mode page background
only — dark mode keeps its `gray-900` canvas.

**Valid tones:** `neutral` (default — `gray-200`), `light` (`gray-100`,
the original airier canvas), `soft`, `slate`, `sand`, `mist`. The token is
a name, not a colour: the frontend (`assets/main.css`) owns the actual hex
for each tone, so the palette can be retuned without a schema or data
migration.

**Valid tile previews:** `full_width` (default — the first-page thumbnail
fills the tile width, top-aligned, lower part of the page cropped) and
`whole_page` (the entire first page shown letterboxed inside the tile). The
token names a render mode; the frontend owns the CSS object-fit for each.

**Tolerant validation.** An unknown tone resolves to `neutral` and an unknown
tile preview to `full_width` — `200` with the default, never `422` — matching
`dashboard_fields`. `tile_preview` is also optional in the body (defaults to
`full_width`), so a client sending only `background_tone` still succeeds. On
read, absent keys resolve to their defaults.

## 1.11 Ask — `POST /api/ask`

Answer a natural-language question about the archive, grounded in retrieved
documents. The narrative — architecture, the two question classes, config and
cost — is in [ask.md](ask.md); this is the wire contract.

**Request:** `{"question": "<1..1000 chars>"}`. Auth + CSRF apply (it is a
`POST`).

**Response `200`:**

```json
{
  "answer": "Yes — your contract grants a travel allowance of €0.21/km [#42].",
  "citations": [{"document_id": 42, "title": "Employment contract"}],
  "used_tools": ["semantic_search"],
  "cost_usd": 0.0031
}
```

- `answer` — prose, grounded only in retrieved documents; it says plainly when
  the archive does not contain the answer (then `citations` is empty).
- `citations` — the documents the answer relied on (id + title); link these to
  `GET /api/documents/{id}`.
- `used_tools` — which retrieval tools the engine invoked
  (`semantic_search`, `query_documents`).
- `cost_usd` — estimated answer cost (recorded in `ask_logs`, not gated).

**Errors:** `503` when no Anthropic API key is configured (answering needs
Claude); `422` when the question is empty or too long.
